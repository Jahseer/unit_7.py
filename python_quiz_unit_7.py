    # A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You use functions in programming to bundle a set of instructions that you want to use repeatedly or that, because of their complexity, are better self-contained in a sub-program and called when needed
# The method operates the data in the class, while a function is used to return or pass the data. A function can be directly called by its name, while a method can't be called by its name.
    # The dictionary is an unordered collection that contains key:value pairs separated by commas inside curly brackets ,  Dictionaries are optimized to retrieve values when the key is known.
# It's used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects.
    # Classes are for bundling related data (and usually code). Dictionaries are for storing key-value relationships, where usually the keys are all of the same type, and all the values are also of one type.
#create a dictionary
my_cities = {'miami', 'washington DC', 'paris', 'london', 'Dubui'}
# check data type 
print(type(my_cities))
print(my_cities)
#output
#{'miami': 'washington Dc', 'paris': 'london', 'Dubui')
